    for help with migrating your app.

    ## What's new?

    This release includes bug fixes, enhancements, doc improvements, and new features.
    You can see a full list on our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/luckyframework/lucky/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#changes-in-019).

    Here are some of the most important enhancements.

    ### Change tracking

    Somtimes you want to perform an action only if certain attributes change,
    or you may want to audit changes to database attributes. This is now
    simple to do with the new change tracking methods on attributes:

    ```crystal
    class SaveUser < User::SaveOperation
      permit_columns email, admin

      before_save do
        if admin.changed?(to: true)
          # Send an email, add permissions, etc.
        end

        if name.changed?
          Lucky.logger.info(name_changed_from: name.original_value, to: name.value)
        end
      end
    end
    ```

    View more details in the
    [change tracking guide](#{Guides::Database::ValidatingSaving.path(anchor: Guides::Database::ValidatingSaving::ANCHOR_CHANGE_TRACKING)}).

    ### Built-in Gzipping (compression) of static assets

    By default Lucky's webpack setup will now compress assets with Gzip when
    in production. Lucky's new `Lucky::StaticCompressionHandler.new` will
    look for gzipped assets and use those if the client accepts Gzipped
    content. The handler can also be customized to look for assets compressed
    with other algorithms like Brotli.

    ### Built-in Gzipping of text responses

    Text responses like HTML, JSON, and XML are now Gzipped by default when
    in production. This can be disabled if you have something in front of
    Lucky that handles gzipping, but making this the default out of the box
    experience means people should have an even easier time making high
    performance applications with Lucky.
