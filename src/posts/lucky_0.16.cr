    <<-MD
    Lucky v0.16.0 is now out and has support for the newest Crystal (v0.30.0)!

    We decided to keep this release small so you have a chance to upgrade Crystal,
    and not worry about so many changes to Lucky (yet ðŸ˜‰). This release is the same
    as v0.15.1 which was released on June 12th, 2019.

    Please be sure to report any [issues](https://github.com/luckyframework/lucky/issues) you
    may run in to. Using this version will help us to launch the next version quicker which will
    be huge!
