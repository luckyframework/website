    Lucky v1.2.0 has been released with lots of great new updates and features.

    Read through the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/luckyframework/lucky/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
    for all of the changes, but we will discuss some of the highlights here.

    ### How to upgrade

    See the [UPGRADE_NOTES](https://github.com/luckyframework/lucky/blob/main/UPGRADE_NOTES.md#upgrading-from-110-to-120).

    You can also view the changes using [LuckyDiff](https://luckydiff.com/?from=1.1.0&to=1.2.0).

    ## Here's what's new

    ### Installing Lucky on Windows

    While Lucky doesn't quite have 100% Windows compatibility, we do have a way for you to start testing things
    by installing Lucky on Windows via [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/).

    This is a huge step forward for Crystal on Windows in general. As Crystal's support for Windows grows, we
    will need to ensure the entire ecosystem is right there. You can check out our official [scoop bucket](https://github.com/luckyframework/scoop-bucket)
    for instructions on installing, or to help contribute.

    ### DB.mapping replaced with DB::Serializable

    Avram models use [crystal-db](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-db/) under the hood to build the
    columns. Previously we used `DB.mapping` to construct the columns, but as of [this PR](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-db/pull/196),
    that way has been deprecated in favor of using `DB::Serializable`. This is now more consistent with `JSON::Serialzable` and
    `YAML::Serializable`, but it does come with a small breaking change.

    `DB::Serializable` is a module that is included in `Avram::Model`. It works by mapping the instance variables to columns
    in the database. This also means that any instance variable you've defined as custom will be mistaken for a database related column.
    To avoid this, you will need to add the annotation `@[DB::Field(ignore: true)]` to any instance variable you may have added
    in your model.

    ```crystal
    class MyModel < BaseModel
      table do
        column name : String
      end

      @[DB::Field(ignore: true)]
      property special_field : String
    end
    ```

    ### Lots of new Critera methods

    The Criteria methods in Avram are query methods used around specific column types. For example,
    the `String` column types have criteria methods `upper` and `lower` which allow you to transform
    the column with `UPPER(col)` or `LOWER(col)` which can be used for special comparrisons.

    In this release, we have added a LOT more. The `String` type added `length` and `reverse`.
    `Int` and `Float` types received a few `abs`, `ceil`, and `floor`.

    ```crystal
    # Find all users that have a username length of 8
    UserQuery.new.username.length.eq(8)

    # Find all cards with this palindrome
    CardQuery.new.title.reverse.eq("tacocat")

    # Find all purchases where the rounded-up amount is greater than 5
    PurchaseQuery.new.amount.ceil.gt(5)

    # Turn a negative number in to positive, and use in your query
    PointQuery.new.x_position.abs.lte(1)
    ```

    To add to these great methods, we've also added `JSON::Any` critera methods. Querying jsonb fields
    can be a bit tricky, and Avram now allows you to avoid a few unsafe raw WHERE queries by using type-safe ones.

    ```crystal
    # Where the preferences jsonb has the key 'theme'
    UserQuery.new.preferences.has_key("theme")

    # Where the preferences jsonb has the key 'theme' or the key 'color'
    UserQuery.new.preferences.has_any_keys(["theme", "color"])

    # Where the preferences jsonb has the key 'theme' and the key 'color'
    UserQuery.new.preferences.has_all_keys(["theme", "color"])

    # Where the preferences jsonb contains the JSON {"theme": "dark"}
    UserQuery.new.preferences.includes({theme: "dark"})

    # Where the preferences jsonb is found in this json document
    UserQuery.new.preferences.in(large_json_document)
    ```

    Finally, `String` also received a few more Criteria related to Full-Text searching.

    Convert a `String` column `to_tsquery` or `to_tsvector` by using those methods names in
    conjunction with the new `match` method.

    ```crystal
    # SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE TO_TSVECTOR(description) @@ TO_TSQUERY('Lucky')
    ProfileQuery.new.description.to_tsvector.match("Lucky")
    ```

    ### New migration methods

    Migrations received a few updates. You can now run your `create` and `alter` conditionally
    with `if_not_exists` and `if_exists` respectively.

    ```crystal
    # Only create the table if it does not already exist
    create table_for(Server), if_not_exists: true do
      add hostname : String
    end
    ```

    You can also ignore the index created on `add_belongs_to` by specifying `index: false`.

    ```crystal
    alter table_for(Reaction), if_exists: true do
      add_belongs_to user : User?, index: false
      add_belongs_to friend : User?, index: false
    end
    ```

    This will allow you to create a custom, unique index utilizing multiple columns instead of separate indexes on each column.

    We've also added the `create_sequence` and `drop_sequence` helpers.

    ```crystal
    def migrate
      create_sequence table_for(Account), :number
    end

    def rollback
      drop_sequence table_for(Account), :number
    end
    ```

    ### The IGNORE constant

    In Avram, the attributes defined on operations are a union of the type you specified, and `Avram::Nothing`.
    Passing `nil` during an operation sets a value to `NULL` in the database. In contrast, using `Avram::Nothing` ignores the value; the value is unchanged.

    Previously, each attribute would define a default value of `Avram::Nothing.new`. The larger your application grew,
    the more instances of `Avram::Nothing` you would have. These have all been replaced with a single instance of `Avram::Nothing`
    assigned as the constant `IGNORE`.

    Use the `IGNORE` constant in place of instantiating `Avram::Nothing` when you want to fallback to ignoring a column in a SaveOperation.

    ```crystal
    # Before the update
    UpdateUserEmail.update!(
      current_user,
      email: new_email.presence || Avram::Nothing.new
    )

    # After the update
    # If `new_email.presence` is nil, then just ignore this update
    UpdateUserEmail.update!(
      current_user,
      email: new_email.presence || IGNORE
    )
    ```

    ### Email attachments

    Carbon received a nice update that adds of [attachment support](https://github.com/luckyframework/carbon/pull/88).

    ```crystal
    class BirthdayEmail < BaseEmail
      def initiailize(@recipient : Carbon::Emailable)
        @image = IO::Memory.new
        File.open("birthday_cake.png") do |f|
          IO.copy(f, @image)
        end
      end

      subject "Happy Birthday"
      to @recipient
      templates html
      attachment cake

      def cake
        {
          io: @image,
          file_name: "birthday_cake.png",
          mime_type: "image/png"
        }
      end
    end
    ```
