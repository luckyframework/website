    ### How to upgrade

    See the [UPGRADE_NOTES](https://github.com/luckyframework/lucky/blob/master/UPGRADE_NOTES.md#upgrading-from-023-to-024).

    Or you can view the changes using [LuckyDiff](https://luckydiff.com/?from=0.23.0&to=0.24.0).
    This tool helps see what has changed between versions and will be included in upgrade notes from now on.

    ## Here's what's new

    ### `m` is now `mount` (again)

    Ok, so sometimes you get a great idea, and try it out, and then later realize maybe it wasn't the best ðŸ˜….
    When we changed `mount` to be `m`, we also changed the signature which paves the way for some pretty neat
    future updates we have planned.

    We realized that `m` is hard to search for, and it's a little confusing to newcomers, so we've reverted the
    name back to `mount`; however, we kept the same signature.

    ```crystal
    # in Lucky 0.23
    m Shared::Footer, year: 2020

    # in Lucky 0.24
    mount Shared::Footer, year: 2020
    ```

    A simple rename, and you're good to go!

    ### New `data` method

    Your Action classes will always return some response whether it's `json()` for your API,
    or `html()` for your browser apps. Now we have `data()` which can be used for responding with
    the contents of a file or other data.

    > For anyone familiar with using Ruby on Rails, this is similar to the Rails
    `send_data` method.

    ```crystal
    class Reports::Show < BrowserAction

      get "/reports/:id" do
        info = gather_data(id)

        data(info, disposition: "inline")
      end
    end
    ```

    ### Disallow external refs in `redirect_back`

    In Lucky 0.23.0 we added the `redirect_back` method to redirect a user back to the referer or a specified
    fallback path. In this version, we've disallowed redirecting back to external hosts unless you specify.

    ```crystal
    redirect_back fallback: Home::Index, allow_external: true
    ```

    ### Renamed `PostgresURL` to `Credentials`

    When configuring your database in `config/database.cr`, you would set your URL string, or
    pass a few options to `PostgresURL`. We've renamed this to `Avram::Credentials` which allows us
    to validate your connection string at compile time.

    Before this release, you could have this:

    ```crystal
    # in config/database.cr
    settings.url = Avram::PostgresURL.build(
      #...
      username: `whoami`
    )
    ```

    Doing this would cause your username to be set as `"myuser\n"` which could lead to some issues.
    Now we can catch that, and have a better structure for adding future validations as other edge cases arise.

    ```crystal
    # in config/database.cr
    settings.credentials = Avram::Credentials.new(
      #...
      username: "myuser"
    )
    ```

    Along with the better safety, we also now have a standard for apps to use that don't need to connect to a database.
    (Like this website).

    ```crystal
    # in config/database.cr
    settings.credentials = Avram::Credentials.void
    ```

    ### Box `build_attributes`

    When you're writing your tests, you'll use Boxes as factories for your models. In this release,
    we've added in a method to return a `NamedTuple` of the attributes without creating a new record.

    ```crystal
    class AdminBox < BaseBox
      def initialize
        name "Admin"
      end
    end

    admin_attrs = AdminBox.build_attributes

    admin_attrs[:name] == "Admin"
    ```

    ### Moving from Gitter to Discord

    Starting with this release, we've decided to move our community forum over to Discord. This
    was by no means a quick decision, and has been in the works with the core team for quite some time.
    To clarify a few of our reasons for choosing an alternate platform:

    * Better mobile support - We find ourselves AFK often, but still want to help when help is needed, even on the go.
    * Better emoji/reaction/giph supprt - This may seem silly, but when chatting online, it's hard to gauge emotion.
      This can change how a community is percieved by a simple thumbs up or funny gif.
    * Better syntax highlighting - Discord allows you to use GFM and specify your language in code blocks. Neat!
    * Better searching - Finding comments from past conversations was pretty common, and needed to be easier
      so we could go back to reference.
    * Plus all of the other things we looked for - easy onboarding, free, not self-hosted, widely used / well supported
      and not buggy

    We understand this is a big change, so please bear with us while we give this a test.
