    ## Flash messages

    You can show messages using `flash`. A flash message is a simple String that is
    passed between two actions. This lets a user know if an action was a success
    or a failure. (e.g. "Record was saved successfully")

    ### Type safe flash messages

    The built-in message types are `success`, `failure` and `info`. Using these
    will cause compile-time errors if you accidentally mistype something. It is
    recommended to stick to these whenever possible.

    ```crystal
    # In an action
    flash.success = "It worked!"
    flash.failure = "That did not work"
    flash.info = "Be cool"
    ```

    These will be rendered by the flash component in
    `src/components/shared/flash_messages.cr`. The flash component is called from
    your `MainLayout` and `AuthLayout` (found in `src/pages/`) by the
    `render_flash` method.

    You can modify the layout or the component to add HTML classes, change where
    flash is rendered, etc.

    ### Setting other messages

    The built-in messages are `success`, `failure` and `info`, but you can use anything
    you'd like:

    ```crystal
    flash.set("something_special", "Super spesh")
    flash.get("something_special") # => "Super spesh"
    ```

    ### Persisting flash messages through redirect

    By default, flash messages are cleared whenever `redirect` is called. This is illustrated below:

    ```crystal
      class Home::Index < BrowserAction
        get "/" do
          if current_user
            flash.failure = "I won't show, because we're using a redirect!"
            redirect to: Me::Show
          else
            flash.success = "I will show, because we're rendering a page!"
            html Home::IndexPage
          end
        end
      end
    ```

    To show flash messages through a redirect, we must leverage the `flash.keep` method:

    ```crystal
    class Home::Index < BrowserAction
      get "/" do
        if current_user
          flash.keep
          flash.success = "Now I will show, because of flash.keep!"
          redirect to: Me::Show
        else
          flash.success = "I will show, because we're rendering without calling a new action!"
          html Home::IndexPage
        end
      end
    end
    ```
    MD
  end
end
