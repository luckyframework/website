    ## Cookies and Sessions

    You can set and access cookies/session values in Lucky like this:

    ```crystal
    class FooAction < BrowserAction
      get "/foo" do
        cookies.set("name", "Sally")
        cookies.get("name") # Will return "Sally"
        cookies.get?("person") # Will return nil

        # You can use Symbol for your key as well
        session.set(:name, "Sally")
        session.get(:name) # Will return "Sally"
        session.get("person") # oops! An exception is raised because this key doesn't exist
        plain_text "Cookies!"
      end
    end
    ```

    Cookies are encrypted by Lucky by default when you use `set`. If you
    need to set a raw value unencrypted, Lucky gives you that option:

    ```crystal
    cookies.set_raw("name", "Sally") # Sets a raw unencrypted cookie
    cookies.get_raw("name") # Will return "Sally"
    ```

    ### Clearing Sessions and Cookies

    If you need to remove a session, or delete a cookie, do this:

    ```crystal
    # Delete a specific session key
    session.delete(:name)

    # Clear the current session
    session.clear

    # Delete a specific cookie
    cookies.delete("name")
    cookies.deleted?("person") #=> false

    # Delete all cookies
    cookies.clear
    ```

    ### Customize Cookies

    If you need to customize specific [cookie options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie), each cookie is an instance of [HTTP::Cookie](https://crystal-lang.org/api/HTTP/Cookie.html), which gives you access to several helpful methods.

    ```crystal
    # This gives you a HTTP::Cookie or raise an exception
    c_is_for_cookie = cookies.get_raw("cookiedough")

    # Set the name of the cookie to "cookie-dough"
    c_is_for_cookie.name("cookie-dough")

    # Set the value of cookie-dough to "yum"
    c_is_for_cookie.value("yum")

    # Set the path for the cookie to "/baking"
    c_is_for_cookie.path("/baking")

    # Set the expires date to tomorrow
    c_is_for_cookie.expires(1.day.from_now)

    # Set the domain to cookie.monst.er
    c_is_for_cookie.domain("cookie.monst.er")

    # Make the cookie secure
    c_is_for_cookie.secure(true)

    # Set the cookie to HTTP only
    c_is_for_cookie.http_only(true)
    ```
    MD
  end
end
