    ## Securing actions

    Security is a very important part to building an application, and Lucky comes with a few small tools to help you out.

    If you look in your `src/actions/browser_action.cr`, you'll see Lucky has added the `Lucky::ProtectFromForgery` module which helps to protect you against [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery).

    There's a few other modules you can include in your actions to help secure your app against attacks. It's up to you to decide which ones work best for your needs.

    ### `SetFrameGuard`

    This module sets the HTTP header [X-Frame-Options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options).
    It's job is responsible for deciding which site can call your site from within a frame.
    For more information, read up on [Clickjacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking).

    ```crystal
    abstract class BrowserAction < Lucky::Action
      include Lucky::SecureHeaders::SetFrameGuard

      def frame_guard_value
        "deny"
      end
    end
    ```

    > The `frame_guard_value` method is required, and must be `"sameorigin"`, `"deny"`, or a valid URL for your website.

    ### `SetSniffGuard`

    This module sets the HTTP header [X-Content-Type-Options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options).
    It's job is responsible for disabling mime type sniffing.
    For more information, read up on [MIME type security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/compatibility/gg622941(v=vs.85)).

    ```crystal
    abstract class BrowserAction < Lucky::Action
      include Lucky::SecureHeaders::SetSniffGuard
    end
    ```

    ### `SetXSSGuard`

    This module sets the HTTP header [X-XSS-Protection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection).
    It's job is responsible for telling the browser to not render a page if it detects cross-site scripting.
    Lucky disables this header for Internet Explorer version < 9 for you as per recommendations. Read more on [Microsoft](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ieinternals/2011/01/31/controlling-the-xss-filter/).

    ```crystal
    abstract class BrowserAction < Lucky::Action
      include Lucky::SecureHeaders::SetXSSGuard
    end
    ```

    ## Forcing SSL and HSTS

    ['Strict-Transport-Security' header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) is used for telling a browser that this site should only be accessed using HTTPS. 
    Lucky comes with a `Lucky::ForceSSLHandler` handler already included, but disabled by default. To enable this, go to `config/server.cr`, and set the `settings.enabled` option to `true`.

    If you would like to enable HSTS, you can add the options to the `settings.strict_transport_security` option.

    ```crystal
    # config/server.cr

    Lucky::ForceSSLHandler.configure do |settings|
      settings.enabled = Lucky::Env.production?
      settings.strict_transport_security = {max_age: 1.year, include_subdomains: true}
    end
    ```

  end
end
