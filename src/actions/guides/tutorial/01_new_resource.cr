    ## Using the Generator CLI

    Lucky comes with a lot of neat commands to make building your application a little easier.
    From your terminal, type `lucky -h`. Give it a moment to compile, then see a list of the commands you can use.

    For our next section, we will be generating a new "resource"; the "Fortune". In this context, a resource is a Model,
    Action, Page, Component, Query, and Operation. Lucky breaks a resource down in to smaller class components which we
    will discuss over the tutorial.

    > For more information on Lucky CLI commands, read the [Built In Tasks](#{Guides::CommandLineTasks::BuiltIn.path}) guide.

    ### Planning the model

    Before we generate the new resource, we should plan out what this model will need.

    A `User` can write as many "fortunes" as they want, and each `Fortune` will belong to that user.
    The fortunes themselves will be a short bit of text. Pretty simple!

    ### Generating the model

    Let's run our generator CLI task. Enter this command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    lucky gen.resource.browser Fortune text:String
    ```

    The command breaks down like this:

    * The `lucky` CLI command. All Lucky tasks are executed from this
    * `gen.resource.browser` is the name of the command to run
    * `Fortune` is the name of our model
    * `text:String` is the name of the column and its type separated with a colon. You can add as many as you need here, just separate them by a space.

    You can learn more about each CLI command by passing the `-h` or `--help` flag. (e.g. `lucky gen.resource.browser -h`)

    > Some shells may require the last portion to be wrapped in quotes. (i.e. `"text:String"`)

    ## Running the Migration

    Lucky generated a migration file for us located in `db/migrations/#{Time.utc.to_s("%Y%m%d%H%I%S")}_create_fortunes.cr`.
    This migration file will generate a SQL statement for us that will create our "fortunes" table and add the columns our
    table needs like `text`, as well as a few other columns Avram gives to us for free: `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.

    To execute this code, we will run the `db.migrate` CLI task. Enter `lucky db.migrate`:

    ```bash
    lucky db.migrate
    ```

    You should see a response that says "Migrated".

    > For more information on migrations, read the [Migrations](#{Guides::Database::Migrations.path}) guide.

    ## Your Turn

    Now that we've updated our database, we can boot our app to test a few things.

    Try this:

    * Boot your application. (`lucky dev`)
    * *Sign in*, then visit `/fortunes` in your browser.
    * Add a few fortunes, then edit one, and delete one.
    * Sign out of your account, then try to visit `/fortunes`. Notice how it asks you to sign in first?
    * Sign up a new account.
    * View the fortunes page, and notice you can edit the other users fortunes. Oops!
    * Leave at least 1 fortune record.

    We will fix the association issue in the next section.
