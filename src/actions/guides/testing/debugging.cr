    ## Introduction

    Determining why a given test or part of your application is failing can sometimes be difficult. This guide serves as a jumping-off point for some tips and tricks that you
    can use to resolve these issues quicker while developing your Lucky applications.

    ## REPL Alternatives

    If your background comes from a framework like [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), you may be familiar with the `rails console` which allows you to run arbitrary
    code related to your app. This is especially convienent when you need to run a quick query, or check that code behaves the way you expect it to.

    Crystal doesn't have any built-in REPL capabilities, and with the nature of how Crystal works, making an interactive REPL can be difficult. Lucky for you (get it? ðŸ˜œ),
    we have a few options that can help you as alternatives.

    ### Lucky exec

    Lucky apps come with a built-in task called `lucky exec`. When you run this command from your terminal, an editor will open up to a file that will require your app.
    You can write any code related to your application within this file. When you save and exit the file, Crystal will compile the file, then execute the code within.
    After the code is executed, you can either press the "enter" key to edit your script, or type `q` to quit.

    ### Crystal play

    Crystal comes with "playground" app that allows you to run Crystal code, and see the output from your browser. Run `crystal play` from the root of your Lucky app,
    and you'll see a mini-server boot on port 8080. Open up your browser to `localhost:8080` to use. As you type, the playground will start to compile, and execute the code
    for you.

    To access your app's code, just add `require "./src/app"` to the top of the input, and your code snippets below.

    > You can also visit https://play.crystal-lang.org for testing bits of code. Note that you don't have access to your application from this option.

    ## Debugging Lucky Flow

    ### Taking Screenshots

    When you're running an integration spec that tests your application interface using Lucky Flow, sometimes getting a picture of what's going on at a certain point on the screen can be incredibly helpful when diagnosing a failing test.

    Say that we have the following spec file:

    ```crystal
    require "../spec_helper"

    describe "Authentication flow" do
      it "works" do
        flow = AuthenticationFlow.new("test@example.com")

        flow.sign_up "password"
        flow.should_be_signed_in
        flow.sign_out
        flow.sign_in "wrong-password"
        flow.should_have_password_error
        flow.sign_in "password"
        flow.should_be_signed_in
      end
    end
    ```

    If we wanted to see what the state of the interface looks like after the `flow.should_be_signed_in` step, all we need to do is insert a `flow.open_screenshot` method call like so:

    ```crystal
    require "../spec_helper"

    describe "Authentication flow" do
      it "works" do
        flow = AuthenticationFlow.new("test@example.com")

        flow.sign_up "password"
        flow.should_be_signed_in

        # Take a picture of the screen, then open the file up
        flow.open_screenshot

        flow.sign_out
        flow.sign_in "wrong-password"
        flow.should_have_password_error
        flow.sign_in "password"
        flow.should_be_signed_in
      end
    end
    ```

    The next time this test file runs, a screenshot of the state of the interface at that point in time will be opened in your default image viewer
    allowing you to diagnose the problem, and get one step closer to a passing test!

    If you'd like to output screenshots to a different location from LuckyFlow, you can easily modify the path defined by the `screenshot_directory` setting:

    ```crystal
    LuckyFlow.configure do
      settings.screenshot_directory = "./tmp/my_custom_folder"
    end
    ```

    > If `open_screenshot` fails, or you don't want the image to auto-open, you can use `flow.take_screenshot`.
    > Look for the image in the `./tmp/screenshots` folder to open the image manually.

    ### Showing the browser

    In your `spec/setup/configure_lucky_flow.cr` file, you can update the `driver` setting to
    `LuckyFlow::Drivers::Chrome`. By updating this, when you run your specs, you will see the
    browser open up and watch it run through each flow.

    ```crystal
    # spec/setup/configure_lucky_flow.cr
    LuckyFlow.configure do |settings|

      # Update this setting
      settings.driver = LuckyFlow::Drivers::Chrome

      # Set back to `LuckyFlow::Drivers::HeadlessChrome` or
      # just remove the setting when you're done.
    end
    ```

    ### Pausing the flow

    Within your flow object, you can call the `pause` method which will temporarily pause your
    flow on whichever page it's on.

    ```crystal
    # spec/support/flows/publish_post_flow.cr
    def start_draft
      visit Articles::Index

      pause

      click "@new-post"
    end
    ```

    Once you're satisifed, go back to your terminal and hit the "enter" key to resume your flow.

    > This is best used in conjunction with the non-headless driver option.
